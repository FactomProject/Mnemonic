### How to Check Your Factoid Balance 

Here is a step by step guide to check your Factoid balance for Mac, Linux, and Windows with our new app, Factom Keymaker. Note that you will require you koinify wallet 12 digit passphrase to get your Factoid Address with our keymaker.

**Step #1** - Go to Factom’s Keymaker repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/FactomProject/keymaker/tree/master/bin). There you will find binaries for [Windows](https://github.com/FactomProject/keymaker/raw/master/bin/keymaker.exe), [Mac](https://github.com/FactomProject/keymaker/raw/master/bin/keymaker-mac), and [Linux](https://github.com/FactomProject/keymaker/raw/master/bin/keymaker-linux).

**Step #2** - Download the one for your OS.

**Step #3** - Save it to a folder of your choice on your local hard drive. 

**Step #4** - Pick the instructions for your OS.

####Linux

Locate the keymaker-linux file you just downloaded in your terminal. We need to first assign execute privileges to the executable by typing the following command:
```
chmod 775 keymaker-linux
```

```
chmod 775
```
Then drag and drop the keymaker-mac app to the Terminal window. You should see the below displayed in Terminal. Hit enter after that.

#### Windows
Open a command prompt (CMD.exe) and browse to the folder that contains keymaker.exe, for example, by typing: C: (or whatever letter your hard drive is); then you can type:
```
cd c:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\
```
If you can’t locate the keymaker.exe this way, just locate it with Windows Explorer and your mouse then drag and drop it to the CMD window. You should see the below on your CMD window.
